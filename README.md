Visualizing the Effects of Female Education and Employment on Overall Country Development - A Case Study on Bangladesh

Dynamic Visualizations of Bangladesh data to provide key insights about the effects of gender development on the socioeconomic status of a country.
This dashboard demonstrates the important of female education on economic growth indicators and population vulnerability measures. 

Information on the Dataset Used:

Female Employment versus Socioeconomic Factors (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdmuhtasimbillah/femaleemployment-vs-socioeconimic-factors?resource=download). 

This data is based on a survey of the population of Bangladesh and spans from 1995 to 2019. The dataset was pretty clean aside from
two missing values for fertility rate in 2018 and 2019, which I manually filled in. Because birth
rate and death rate are both important indicators of country development, I decided to also
manually add those in as columns into the dataset. I found the values for these rates on the World
Bank website (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN?locations=BD). I came
up with three sketches based on these project motivations, with the goal of each visualization
representing development based on different contributing factors like female employment rate,
fertility rate, vulnerable employment, birth rate, and death rate.
